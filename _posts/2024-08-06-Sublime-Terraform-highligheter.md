Just a small post to remind myself where to find the repo to install the **Terraform** syntax highlighter for `.tf` and `.tfvars` files.

Installation notes part of the repo's `README.md` file are very straightforward.

- [GitHub repo: Terraform support for Sublime Text 3](https://github.com/tmichel/sublime-terraform)

Once installed, this can be activated in Sublime 3 text editor in **View > Syntax > Terraform**
